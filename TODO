* TODO 
1. [ ] Change the IDE header so it is 2x22 instead of two connectors.
2. [ ] IDE header orientation is wrong, change it to match the riser board.
3. [ ] PMOD orientation is wrong. Check the standard again and fix it.
4. [ ] Before posting anything online, state that the name SaigyouGDROM 
       is trademarked.
