SaigyouGDROM is a redesigned hardware implementation for Marcus Comstedt's
"iceGDROM". The aim of the project is to use the original software and gateware,
but with the hardware redesigned for a complete package.

This is currently a work in progress. Although the first revision prototypes have
been manufactured, there is still a lot to do in regards for testing and
recompiling the firmware and gateware for the new hardware.
